**auto-websetup**: This git repository contains multiple versions of the websetp.sh script which i have developed to automate the process of website deployment on the apache tomcat server on the ubuntu machine.

**Note** : the script need the link of the template link as an argument tp the script. All the dependencies are already included in the script so you dont need to download anything manually.<br>
**how to use** : just type the following command *./'scriptname' 'link of template'* <br>
You can dismantle the setup and clean up the residual file by executing the "*dismantle.sh*" script.
