**auto-websetup**: This git repository contains multiple versions of the websetp.sh script which i have developed to automate the process of website deployment on the apache webserver on the linux machine.

**Note** : the script need the link of the template link(from tooplate.com) as an argument to the script. All the dependencies are already included in the script so you dont need to download anything manually.<br>
**how to use** : just type the following command *./'scriptname' 'link of template'* <br>
You can dismantle the setup and clean up the residual file by executing the "*dismantle.sh*" script. <br>
